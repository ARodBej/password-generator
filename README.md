# Password Generator Starter Code
With the starter code, I was able to generate a password when the button it clicked.

The user has to go throught the prompts and decide whether they want numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters. 

Once the user has their desired passowrd, they can generate a new password again without refreshing the page. 

The way I generated the password was I confirmed if they pick ok and let the code pick a random option from the array I listed above. In order to reach the desired length, I did a while loop so the code can keep picking random characters from all of the arrays then stops when it has the right amount for the password.
